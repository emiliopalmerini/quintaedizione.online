# Open Source Production Implementation Plan

## Summary

This plan addresses the 3 major improvements for preparing this D&D 5e SRD project for open source production deployment:

1. ✅ **Production Readiness Assessment**: Critical gaps identified for open source context
2. ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture + DDD**: Domain entities and value objects implemented  
3. ✅ **Improved Classes Parser**: Now matches ADR requirements completely

## 1. Architecture Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation

**New Domain Structure:**
```
srd_parser/domain/
├── entities.py          # DndClass, Subclass, ClassProgressions aggregates
├── value_objects.py     # Level, Ability, ClassSlug, etc.
├── services.py          # ClassParsingService business logic
└── __init__.py
```

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Rich domain model with proper validation
- ✅ Immutable value objects (Level, Ability, ClassSlug)
- ✅ Domain entities with business logic
- ✅ Complete separation of parsing concerns
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture foundation

### Improved Classes Parser ✅ COMPLETED

**New Parser Features:**
- ✅ Uses domain entities instead of raw dicts
- ✅ Handles ALL ADR fields: `sottotitolo`, `multiclasse`, `progressioni`, `magia`, `regole_classe`, `raccomandazioni`
- ✅ Proper spell slot parsing with validation
- ✅ Resource progression tracking
- ✅ Subclass feature extraction
- ✅ Magic system detection and configuration
- ✅ Class rule extraction (durations, limitations, formulas)

## 2. Open Source Production Readiness

### Community & Contributor Setup ✅ COMPLETED

```bash
# Community Infrastructure:

1. Documentation & Onboarding
   ✅ Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md - DONE
   🔄 Setup GitHub issue/PR templates - PENDING
   🔄 Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md - PENDING
   ✅ Docker dev environment with hot-reload - DONE

2. Developer Experience

   ✅ Seed data included for quick testing (make seed-restore) - DONE
   ✅ Clear Makefile with dev commands - DONE
   🔄 Automated testing with GitHub Actions - PENDING
```

### Security for Public API ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

```bash
# Open Source Security Focus:

1. Input Validation & DoS Protection
   - Rate limiting by IP (prevent spam/DoS)
   - Request size limits (prevent large payloads)
   - Comprehensive markdown sanitization
   - CORS policy for embedding/integration

2. Container Security
   - Run containers as non-root user
   - Security scanning in CI pipeline
   - Minimal Docker images (distroless/alpine)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

3. Secret Management (Simplified)
   - Move credentials to .env files
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Clear deployment documentation
```

### Infrastructure for Open Source ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

```bash
# Self-Hosted & Free Tools:

1. Monitoring Stack (Free/Open Source)
   - Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
   - Loki for log aggregation (lighter than ELK)
   - Simple health endpoints (/health, /metrics)
   - Jaeger for distributed tracing

2. CI/CD Pipeline
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Docker image building and security scanning
   - Automated releases with semantic versioning
   - Multi-architecture builds (ARM64/AMD64)

3. Deployment Options
   - Docker Compose for simple deployment
   - Kubernetes Helm charts for scalable deployment
   - Clear cloud provider setup guides
   - Self-hosting documentation
```
