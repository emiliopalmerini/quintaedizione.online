# Equipment

## Coins

Characters often find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece.

A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Table: Coin Values

| Coin                | Value in GP |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Copper Piece (CP)   | 1/100       |
| Silver Piece (SP)   | 1/10        |
| Electrum Piece (EP) | 1/2         |
| Gold Piece (GP)     | 1           |
| Platinum Piece (PP) | 10          |

### Selling Equipment

Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art objects—retain their full value in the marketplace. "Magic Items" has prices for magic items.

## Weapons

The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the "Properties" section.
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the "Mastery Properties" section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

### Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

#### Finesse

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy

You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

#### Light

When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Loading

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Range

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Reach

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

#### Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

#### Two-Handed

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### Versatile

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

> ### Improvised Weapons
>
> If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "Improvised Weapons" in "Rules Glossary." Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

#### Cleave

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Nick

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

#### Topple

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

#### Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

## Armor

The Armor table lists the game's main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).
- **Armor Class (AC).** The table's Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
- **Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
- **Stealth.** If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Armor Training

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Shield

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

### One at a Time

A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.

## Tools

A tool helps you make specialized ability checks, craft certain items, or both. A tool's description includes the tool's cost and weight, as well as the following entries:

- **Ability.** This entry lists the ability to use when making an ability check with the tool.
- **Utilize.** This entry lists things you can do with the tool when you take the Utilize action. You can do one of those things each time you take the action. This entry also provides the DC for the action.
- **Craft.** This entry lists what, if anything, you can craft with the tool. For crafting rules, see "Crafting Nonmagical Items," "Brewing Potions of Healing," and "Scribing Spell Scrolls" later in "Equipment."
- **Variants.** This entry appears if the tool has variants, which are listed. Each requires a separate proficiency.

### Tool Proficiency

If you have proficiency with a tool, add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too.

Your features might give you proficiency with a tool. A monster has proficiency with any tool in its stat block.

### Artisan's Tools

Artisan's Tools are each focused on crafting items and pursuing a trade. Each of these tools requires a separate proficiency.

## Mounts and Vehicles

A mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's carrying capacity. See "Monsters" for the animals' stat blocks.

### Mounts and Cargo

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add their carrying capacities together.

### Barding

Barding is armor designed for a mount. Any type of armor on the Armor table in "Equipment" can

be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.

### Saddles

A saddle comes with a bit, a bridle, reins, and any other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Military Saddle gives Advantage on any ability check you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is required for riding an aquatic or a flying mount.

Table: Mounts and Other Animals

| Item          | Carrying Capacity | Cost   |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Camel         | 450 lb.           | 50 GP  |
| Elephant      | 1,320 lb.         | 200 GP |
| Horse, Draft  | 540 lb.           | 50 GP  |

### Large Vehicles

The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides statistics for various types of large vehicles. The following notes apply.

#### Speed

A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.

Table: Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles

| Ship         | Speed  | Crew | Passengers | Cargo (Tons) | AC | HP  | Damage Threshold | Cost      |
|--------------|--------|------|------------|--------------|----|-----|------------------|-----------|
| Airship      | 8 mph  | 10   | 20         | 1            | 13 | 300 | —                | 40,000 GP |
| Galley       | 4 mph  | 80   | —          | 150          | 15 | 500 | 20               | 30,000 GP |
| Keelboat     | 1 mph  | 1    | 6          | 1/2          | 15 | 100 | 10               | 3,000 GP  |
| Longship     | 3 mph  | 40   | 150        | 10           | 15 | 300 | 15               | 10,000 GP |
| Rowboat      | 1½ mph | 1    | 3          | —            | 11 | 50  | —                | 50 GP     |
| Sailing Ship | 2 mph  | 20   | 20         | 100          | 15 | 300 | 15               | 10,000 GP |
| Warship      | 2½ mph | 60   | 60         | 200          | 15 | 500 | 20               | 25,000 GP |

#### Crew

A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see "Hirelings" later in "Equipment") to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.

#### Passengers

The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.

#### Damage Threshold

If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see "Rules Glossary"), it's noted in the table.

#### Ship Repair

Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.

## Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (GM's choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the GM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

### Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.

### Squalid (1 SP per Day)

You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.

### Poor (2 SP per Day)

You spend frugally for your necessities.

### Modest (1 GP per Day)

You support yourself at an average level.

### Comfortable (2 GP per Day)

You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.

### Wealthy (4 GP per Day)

You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.

### Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)

You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for food and a single night's lodging. Prices for daily lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle's expenses.

Table: Food, Drink

| Item                   | Cost  |
|------------------------|-------|
| Ale (mug)              | 4 CP  |
| Bread (loaf)           | 2 CP  |
| Cheese (wedge)         | 1 SP  |
| Meal - Squalid         | 1 CP  |
| Meal - Poor            | 2 CP  |
| Meal - Modest          | 1 SP  |
| Meal - Comfortable     | 2 SP  |
| Meal - Wealthy         | 3 SP  |
| Meal - Aristocratic    | 6 SP  |
| Wine (bottle) - Common | 2 SP  |
| Wine (bottle) - Fine   | 10 GP |

Table: Inn Stay per Day

| Item             | Cost |
|------------------|------|
| Squalid          | 7 CP |
| Poor             | 1 SP |
| Modest           | 5 SP |
| Comfortable      | 8 SP |
| Wealthy          | 2 GP |
| Aristocratic     | 4 GP |

## **Hirelings**

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, an artisan, a scribe, or the like. The pay shown on the Hirelings table is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for work that requires no particular proficiencies; they include laborers and porters.

Table: Hirelings

| Service            | Cost          |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Skilled hireling   | 2 GP per day  |
| Untrained hireling | 2 SP per day  |
| Messenger          | 2 CP per mile |

## Spellcasting

Most settlements contain individuals who are willing to cast spells in exchange for payment. If a spell has expensive components, add the cost of those components to the cost listed in the Spellcasting Services table. The higher the level of a desired spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

Table: Spellcasting Services

| Spell Level | Availability           | Cost       |
|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| Cantrip     | Village, town, or city | 30 GP      |
| 1           | Village, town, or city | 50 GP      |
| 2           | Village, town, or city | 200 GP     |
| 3           | Town or city only      | 300 GP     |
| 4–5         | Town or city only      | 2,000 GP   |
| 6–8         | City only              | 20,000 GP  |
| 9           | City only              | 100,000 GP |

## Magic Items

Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in "Magic Items" later in this document. Here's what you need to know about using magic items.

### Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item's properties isn't automatic.

The *Identify* spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a Short Rest while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear).

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it's a *Ring of Feather Falling*.

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a *Ring of Swimming*, the GM might say, "Your movement feels strangely fluid." Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.

### Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

#### Attune during a Short Rest

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.

#### No More Than Three Items

You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one *Ring of Protection* at a time.

#### Ending Attunement

Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item unless the item is cursed.

### Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind

You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.

#### Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a *Boot of Striding and Springing* on one foot and a *Boot of Elvenkind* on the other foot gains no benefit from either.

## Crafting Nonmagical Items

To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.

### Required Tools

The "Tools" section of "Equipment" lists which tools are required to make certain items. The GM assigns required tools for items not listed there.

You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.

### Raw Materials

To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.

### Time

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.

If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive.

Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.

## Brewing Potions of Healing

A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism Kit can create a *Potion of Healing*. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work).

## **Scribing Spell Scrolls**

A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a *Spell Scroll*, using the rules below.

### Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.

### Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Supplies and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

### **Cantrips**

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.

Table: Spell Scroll Costs

| Spell Level | Time     | Cost      |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Cantrip     | 1 day    | 15 GP     |
| 1           | 1 day    | 25 GP     |
| 2           | 3 days   | 100 GP    |
| 3           | 5 days   | 150 GP    |
| 4           | 10 days  | 1,000 GP  |
| 5           | 25 days  | 1,500 GP  |
| 6           | 40 days  | 10,000 GP |
| 7           | 50 days  | 12,500 GP |
| 8           | 60 days  | 15,000 GP |
| 9           | 120 days | 50,000 GP |

## Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Magic Item Categories

Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic Item Categories table lists the nine categories and provides examples. Rules for the categories appear after the table.

Table: Magic Item Categories

| Category       | Examples                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Armor          | +1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield        |
| Potions        | Potion of Healing                  |
| Rings          | Ring of Invisibility               |
| Rods           | Immovable Rod                      |
| Scrolls        | Spell Scroll                       |
| Staffs         | Staff of Striking                  |
| Wands          | Wand of Fireballs                  |
| Weapons        | +1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword        |
| Wondrous Items | Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind |

### Magic Armor

An item in the Armor category is typically a magical version of armor from "Equipment." Unless an armor's description notes otherwise, the armor must be worn for its magic to function.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it randomly.

### Potions

An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.

***Using a Potion.*** Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.

***Mixing Potions.*** A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.

When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.

Table: Potion Miscibility

| 1d100 | Result                                                                                                                                      |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01    | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture creates a magical explosion in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force damage. |
| 02–08 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mix ture becomes an ingested poison of your choice (see "Poison" in "Gameplay Toolbox").           |
| 09–15 | Both potions lose their effects.                                                                                                            |
| 16–25 | One potion loses its effect.                                                                                                                |
| 26–35 | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. If a potion has no numerical effect and no duration, it instead loses its effect. |
| 36–90 | Both potions work normally.                                                                                                                 |
| 91–99 | Both potions work, but the numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei ther potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00    | Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a *Potion of Healing* might increase the drinker's Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2, or a *Potion of Invisibility* might give the drinker the Invisible condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a *Dispel Magic* spell or similar magic might end this lasting effect. |

### Rings

For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.

### Rods

An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus.

### Scrolls

An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the *Spell Scroll*, a spell stored in written form.

***Using a Scroll.*** Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.

Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise.

### Staffs

Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus.

### Wands

An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus.

### Magic Weapons

A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from "Equipment." Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no weapon type is specified, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

***Ammunition.*** If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not.

### Wondrous Items

Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and more also fall into this category.

#### **Magic Item Rules**

Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic items appear in "Equipment." Additional rules are presented below.

***Attunement Prerequisites.*** If a magic item has a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not by using a magic item or the like.

***Items Made for Specific Creatures.*** Magic items that are meant to be worn tend to magically adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can decide that a magic item doesn't adjust its size to fit any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might make items usable only by folk who are sized and shaped like dwarves.

***Unusual Anatomy.*** Use your discretion to decide whether a creature can wear an item not made for its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear magic boots.

***Paired Items.*** You can allow exceptions to the rule that paired items must both be worn. For example, a character with only one arm might be able to use a single *Glove of Missile Snaring* so long as the matching glove is on their person.

## Magic Item Rarity

Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table.

Common magic items, such as a *Potion of Healing*, are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the *Dragon Orb*, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.

### Magic Item Values by Rarity

Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment.

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in "Equipment" (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item's cost to the magic item's value. For example, *+1 Armor* (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item's value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate Armor (1,500 GP).

Table: Magic Item Rarities and Values

| Rarity    | Value*     |
|-----------|------------|
| Common    | 100 GP     |
| Uncommon  | 400 GP     |
| Rare      | 4,000 GP   |
| Very Rare | 40,000 GP  |
| Legendary | 200,000 GP |
| Artifact  | Priceless  |

\*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a *Spell Scroll*. The value of a *Spell Scroll* is double what it costs to scribe the scroll (as specified in the "Scribing Spell Scrolls" section of "Equipment").

## Activating a Magic Item

It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item's user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.

### Command Word

A command word is a word or short phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the *Silence* spell.

### Consumable Items

Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A *Potion of Healing* must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

#### Spells Cast from Items

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn't have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the user's Proficiency Bonus applies.

#### Charges

Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the *Identify* spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains.

## The Next Dawn"

Magic items often have charges or properties that recharge at the next dawn or some other specified time. If such an item is on a world or plane of existence where the specified event doesn't occur, the GM determines when the item recharges.

## Cursed Items

A magic item's description specifies whether it bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the *Identify* spell, fail to reveal such a curse.

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a *Remove Curse* spell.

## Magic Item Resilience

A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.

An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires research or the completion of a quest.

## Crafting Magic Items

"Equipment" contains rules on brewing *Potions of Healing* and scribing *Spell Scrolls*. To create other magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, "you" refers to the character crafting the magic item.

### Arcana Proficiency

To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must have proficiency in the Arcana skill.

### Required Tools

The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information on the tools, see "Equipment."

Table: Magic Item Tools

| Item Category | Required Tool                                                                                                                    |

| Rod           | Woodcarver's Tools                                                                                                               |

| Wand          | Woodcarver's Tools                                                                                                               |
| Weapon        | Leatherworker's Tools, Smith's Tools, or Woodcarver's Tools de pending on the kind of weapon as noted in the tools' descriptions |
| Wondrous Item | Tinker's Tools or the tool required to make the nonmagical item on which the magic item is based                                 |

### Spells

If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

### Crafting Time and Cost

Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item's rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.

***Work per Day.*** For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.

***Assistants.*** Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.

***Raw Materials.*** The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren't available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again.

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in "Equipment." For example, to make *+1 Armor* (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

Table: Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

| Item Rarity | Time*    | Cost*      |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Common      | 5 days   | 50 GP      |
| Uncommon    | 10 days  | 200 GP     |
| Rare        | 50 days  | 2,000 GP   |
| Very Rare   | 125 days | 20,000 GP  |
| Legendary   | 250 days | 100,000 GP |

\*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a *Spell Scroll*, whose crafting time and cost are given in "Equipment."

## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

The GM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see "Conflict" below).

### Sentient Magic Item Traits

When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item's persona much as you would create an NPC, with these exceptions.

#### Abilities

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item's abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

#### Alignment

A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item's Alignment table.

#### Communication

A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item's Communication table.

#### Senses

A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the Sentient Item's Senses table.

#### Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see "Conflict" below). You can pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item's Special Purpose table.

Table: Sentient Item's Alignment

| 1d100 | Alignment       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 01–15 | Lawful Good     |
| 16–35 | Neutral Good    |
| 36–50 | Chaotic Good    |
| 51–63 | Lawful Neutral  |

|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–6  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                   |
| 7–9  | The item speaks one or more languages.                                                                                                   |
| 10   | The item speaks one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any creature that carries or wields it. |

| 1    | **Aligned.** The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. Such an item is never Neutral.    |
| 2    | **Bane.** The item seeks to thwart or destroy creatures of a particular type, such as Constructs, Fiends, or Undead.           |
| 3    | **Creator Seeker.** The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                     |
| 4    | **Destiny Seeker.** The item believes it and its bearer have key roles to play in future events.                               |
| 5    | **Destroyer.** The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                            |

#### Conflict

When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item's bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the item makes one or more of the following demands:

**Chase My Dreams.** The item demands that its bearer pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.

**Get Rid of It.** The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.

**It's Time for a Change.** The item demands to be given to someone else.

**Keep Me Close.** The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.

If its bearer refuses to comply with the item's demands, the item can do any of the following:

- Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
- Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
- Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for 1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item's commands. If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.
